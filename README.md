# Task-7.-Pinatas
test task for the internship

After starting the program, you need to enter an array with the number of candies in each pinata, for example: 3 1 5 8

numbers must be separated by a space, not a comma, otherwise an error will result.

After the program starts, you should see the following message "Maximum candies: " and the maximum number of candies you could get. For example, if we entered the previous array “ 3 1 5 8 ”, we will see "Maximum candies: 167".
